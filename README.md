# MathPractice
Math software to build customized problems for elementary students!

Enables user to select and fully customize problem settings (i.e. 2 by 2 multiplication, subtraction, multiplication with/without carry over) and generates problems accordingly. Stores results of students and plots progress.
Implemented nice GUI and helped my little brother learn his multiplication tables!
